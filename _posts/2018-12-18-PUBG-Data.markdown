## Introduction

  Hello! My name is Spencer Szabaday and I will be showing you a splendid server of statistics. These statistics had to do with the ranked player statistics of those who play "Player Unknown's Battlegrounds." Most people simply refer to the game as PUBG (Pub-Gee), so that is how it shall be labeled as from this point on. 
 
 ## Research Question
 
 My research question is simple: **Is there a correlation between how many games someone has played and how often they are within the "Top 10"?** The "Top 10" is defined as one of the last ten surviving players after a 100 player deathmatch, which can be extrapolated as meaning you were one of the ten best players in that match.
